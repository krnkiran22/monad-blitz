# KOALA SEASONS - COMPLETE REBUILD PLAN

## PHASE 1: Audio & Background Systems (30% → 50%)
- [ ] Add background music (jngl.xm or loop)
- [ ] Add missing sounds (resin_hit, owl_die, wind_sound)
- [ ] Create 3-layer parallax system
- [ ] Fix seasonal color tinting (EXACT C colors)
- [ ] Add ground layer tinting

## PHASE 2: Additional Enemies (50% → 70%)
- [ ] Owl enemy + branch prop
- [ ] Bee enemy with sine wave movement
- [ ] Eagle enemy with warning alert
- [ ] Enemy animations (3-5 frames each)

## PHASE 3: Obstacles (70% → 85%)
- [ ] Ice obstacle (slippery tree)
- [ ] Resin obstacle (sticky - need 2 clicks to jump)
- [ ] Wind/Tornado (lifts player up)
- [ ] Proper collision physics

## PHASE 4: Polish (85% → 100%)
- [ ] Multiple leaf sizes (lil, mid, big)
- [ ] All particle systems (fog, rain, storm)
- [ ] Transformation animation
- [ ] Final form flight mechanics
- [ ] Complete UI (progress bars, glows)
- [ ] Kill history display on game over

## FILES TO CREATE:
1. AudioManager.js - Handle all sounds + music
2. ParallaxSystem.js - 3-layer tree rendering
3. EnemyManager.js - All enemy types
4. ObstacleManager.js - Ice, resin, wind
5. ColorTinting.js - Seasonal color system
6. GameScene_COMPLETE.js - Full implementation
